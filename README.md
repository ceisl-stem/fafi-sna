# Family as Faculty as Infrastructure Social Network Analysis

Funded through a Family Engagement and Educator Preparation Innovation Project grant from the National Association for Family, School, and Community Engagement (NAFSCE) and integrated with the SLRP project, FAFI prepares and engages family and community members—particularly those representing intersectionally marginalized identities—as instructors for pre-admissions teacher education students. Family and community members are provided with voice and input in the teacher preparation process and teacher education students develop the dispositions and practices to hear and learn from families.

Funded in part by a [National Association of Family, School, and Community Engagement Minigrant](https://nafsce.org/page/MiniGrant).
